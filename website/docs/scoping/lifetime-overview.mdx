title: Lifetime Overview
---

- Singleton : Single instance per container (includes all parents and children).
- Transient : Instance per resolving.
- Scoped    : Instance per `LifetimeScope`.
  - If LifetimeScope is single, similar to Singleton.
  - If you create a LifetimeScope child, the instance will be different for each child.
  - When LifetimeScope is destroyed, release references and calls all the registered `IDisposable`.

## Lifetime with Parent/Child relationship

`LifetimeScope` can build parent-child relationship.
it has following behaviours:

- If registered object is not found, `LifetimeScope` will look for a parent `LifetimeScope`.
- For `Lifetime.Singleton`
  - Basically, always returns the same instance.
  - If parent and child have the same type, it returns the instance with the closest scope.
  - When a `LifetimeScope` is destroyed, objects with `IDisposable` implemented are called `Dispose()`.
- For `LifeTime.Transient`
  - Instance creating for each resolving.
  - If parent and child have the same registration, the child will create its own instance.
- For `Lifetime.Scoped`
  - Instance will be different for each child.
      - If same child, returns same instance.
  - If parent and child have the same registration, the child will create its own instance.
  - When a `LifetimeScope` is destroyed, objects with `IDisposable` implemented are called `Dispose()`.

:::caution
If scene is alive and only `LifetimeScope` is destroyed, MonoBehaviour registered as `Lifetime.Scoped` is not automatically destroyed.
If you want to destroy with `LifetimeScope`, make it a child transform of `LifetimeScope` or consider implement IDisposable.
