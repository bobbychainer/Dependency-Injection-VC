title: Register Factory
---

VContainer allows to register a `Func<>` delegate for the creation of an instance. This is especially useful in scenarios where instance is created at any time during execution, or multiple instances are created at any time.

By registering Factory instead of instance, you can keep the dependency static and simple.

## Register `Func<>` Factory that requires only runtime parameters

```csharp
builder.RegisterFactory<int, Foo>(x => new Foo(x));
```

We can resolve like below:

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    readonly Func<int, Foo> factory;

    public ClassA(Func<int, Foo> factory)
    {
        this.factory = factory;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        var foo = factory.Invoke(100);
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Register `Func<>` Factory that requires container dependencies and runtime parameters

```csharp
builder.RegisterFactory<int, Foo>(container =>
{
    var dependency = container.Resolve<Dependency>(); // Resolve per scope
    return x => new Foo(x, dependency); // Execute per factory invocation
}, Lifetime.Scoped);
```

This method required 2 params

- `Func<>` : Receives Container and returns Factory.
- `Lifetime` : Determines how often the Factory is generated. (that is, how often the outer Func is executed.)

We can resolve like below:

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    readonly Func<int, Foo> factory;

    public ClassA(Func<int, Foo> factory)
    {
        this.factory = factory;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        var foo = factory.Invoke(100);
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this case, container.Instantiate etc. are also useful.

```csharp
builder.RegisterFactory<CharacterType, CharacterActor>(container =>
{
    return characterType =>
    {
        var characterPrefab = ...
        return container.Instantiate(characterPrefab, parentTransform);
    }
}, Lifetime.Scoped);
```

:::note
`Func <>` factory is like a short hand.
In complex cases, consider defining and registering your own factory classã€‚
