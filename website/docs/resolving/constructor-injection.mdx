title: Constructor Injection
---

VContainer automatically collects and calls registered class constructors.

:::note
- At this time, all the parameters of the constructor must be registered.
- If the dependency cannot be resolved, throws exception when validating LifetimeScope or building Container.
:::

Here is basic idiom with DI.

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    readonly IServiceA serviceA;
    readonly IServiceB serviceB;
    readonly SomeUnityComponent component;

    public ClassA(
        IServiceA serviceA,
        IServiceB serviceB,
        SomeUnityComponent component)
    {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
        this.component = component;
    }
}
```

:::caution
Constructors are often stripped in the IL2CPP environment.
To prevent this problem, add the `[Inject]` Attribute explicitly.
:::

```csharp
    [Inject]
    public ClassA(
        IServiceA serviceA,
        IServiceB serviceB,
        SomeUnityComponent component)
    {
        // ...
    }
```

:::note
If class has multiple constructors, the one with `[Inject]` has priority.
:::

:::tip Recommendation
Use Constructor Injection whenever possible.
The constructor & readonly field idiom is:
- The instantiated object has a compiler-level guarantee that the dependencies have been resolved.
- No magic in the class code. Instantiate easily without DI container. (e.g. Unit testing)
- If you look at the constructor, the dependency is clear.
  - If too many constructor arguments, it can be considered overly responsible.

## MonoBehaviour

MonoBehaviour cannot use a constructor. Use [method injection](./method-injection) instead.
