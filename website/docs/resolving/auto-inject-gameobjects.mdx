title: Auto inject GameObject in the scene
---

In VContainer, objects that are not explicitly registered will not be injected. Therefore, execute Register for the object you want to inject.

If you want to run **"Inject Only"** into MonoBehaviour, you can do so by inserting GameObject in the `autoInjectGameObject` field of LifetimeScope.
