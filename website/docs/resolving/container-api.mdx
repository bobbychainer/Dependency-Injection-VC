title: Container API

You can also use Container's API directly, if needed.

For example:

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    public ClassA(IObjectResolver container)
    {
        // Resolve
        var serviceA = container.Resolve<ServiceA>();

        // Execute Inject on the generated instance
        container.Inject(foo);

        // Execute Inject for all MonoBehaviour contained in GameObject
        container.InjectGameObject(gameObject);

        // Instantiate with Inject
        container.Instantiate(prefab);
        container.Instantiate(prefab, parent);
        container.Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation, parent);
    }
}
```

:::caution
These methods have poor performance (especially if CodeGen is not enabled). Use only if normal DI patterns are not applicable.
:::

LifetimeScope also has a Container reference.

```csharp
class ClassA
{
    public ClassA(LifetimeScope currentScope)
    {
        currentScope.Container...
    }
}
```
