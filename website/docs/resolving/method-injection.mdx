title: Method Injection
---

If constructor injection is not available, use method injection.

Typically this is for MonoBehaviour.

```csharp
public class SomeBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
{
    float speed;

    [Inject]
    public void Construct(GameSettings settings)
    {
        speed = settings.speed;
    }
}
```

:::tip Recommendation
Consider whether injection to MonoBehaviour is necessary.
In a code base where domain logic and presentation are well decoupled, MonoBehaviour should act as a View component.

In my opinion, View components should only be responsible for rendering and should be flexible.

Of course, In order for the View component to work, it needs to pass state at runtime.
But the "state" of an object and its dependency of functionality of other objects are different.

It's enough to pass the state as arguments instead of `[Inject]`.
