title: Method Injection
---

If you need to inject dependencies into a type but can't do so with constructors, consider using method injection instead. This is most useful for `MonoBehaviour`s but can be done with any class, including test cases within the [Unity Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest).

```csharp
public class SomeBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
{
    float speed;

    [Inject]
    public void Construct(GameSettings settings)
    {
        speed = settings.speed;
    }
}
```

The `[Inject]`-annotated method can have any name and any accessibility level.

If you inject dependencies into `MonoBehavior`s, you must be mindful of when the `[Inject]`-annotated method is called with respect to [Unity's object lifecycle](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder). If your [`Awake()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake), [`Start()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Start), or [`OnEnable()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnEnable) methods need any dependencies from VContainer, consider moving their logic into your injection method.

:::tip Recommendation
Consider whether injection into `MonoBehaviour`s is necessary.

In an ideal code base where presentation and domain logic are properly decoupled, `MonoBehaviour`s would act as views that are only responsible for rendering (or other user-visible feedback).

Of course, views still need to be able to access the state of the thing they're displaying (i.e. the game world). But a view can depend on other objects without maintaining its own state. Depending on how your game state is represented, it might be enough to provide it to your views through event arguments or serializable fields rather than `[Inject]`.
