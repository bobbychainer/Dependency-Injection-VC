import {BenchmarkGraph} from "./BenchmarkGraph"

A fatest DI (Dependency Injection) for Unity.

"V" means making Unity's initial "U" more thinner and solid.

- **Fast resolve:** Basically 5-10x faster than Zenject. And has a optimization feature by Pre IL Code generation.
- **Minimum overhead, small code size**: In Resolve, We have **zero allocation** without spawned instances.
- **Flexible scoping**: Application can freely create nested Lifetime Scope.
- **Thread safety and robustness:** VContainer has guarantees for immutability.

## Inversion of Control

DI containers we can make pure C # classes the entry point (not MonoBehaviour). This means that the control flow and other domain logic can be separated from the function of MonoBehaviour as a view component.

## Benchmarking

10,000 iteration for each test cases.
Unity 2019.x / IL2CPP Standalone macOS build.

- VContainer (CodeGen) means


## Simple and transparent API

## Flexible Scoping

Benchmarking:

- By default, both VContainer and Zenject use reflection at runtime.
- "VContainer (CodeGen)" means optimization feature by pre-generation IL code of Inject methods by ILPostProcessor.
    - See [Optimization](#optimization) section  more information.

(VContainer has achieved zero allocation during Resolve.)
