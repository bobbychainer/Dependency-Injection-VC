**VContainer** is an DI (Dependency Injection) library running on Unity (Game Engine).

"V" means making Unity's initial "U" more thinner and solid ... !

- **Fast resolve:** Basically, 5-10x faster than Zenject.
- **Minimum GC allocation**: In Resolve, We have zero allocation without spawned instances.
- **Extra small code size**: Few internal types and few .callvirt.
- **Flexible scoping**: Application can freely create nested Lifetime Scope.
- **IoC**: Create script entry point without MonoBehaviour. (Using own Unity's PlayerLoopSystem)
- **ECS integration**
- **Immutable Container:** Thread safety and robustness.

Benchmarking:

- By default, both VContainer and Zenject use reflection at runtime.
- "VContainer (CodeGen)" means optimization feature by pre-generation IL code of Inject methods by ILPostProcessor.
    - See [Optimization](#optimization) section  more information.

An example of profile results for GC Alloc:

(VContainer has achieved zero allocation during Resolve.)
