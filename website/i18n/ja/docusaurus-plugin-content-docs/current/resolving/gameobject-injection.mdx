As `MonoBehaviour`s [do not support constructors](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake), you must use [method injection](./method-injection) to inject them with dependencies.

Note that the presence of the `[Inject]` attribute on a `MonoBehaviour`'s method **does not** imply that it will automatically be called. You must inject dependencies manually in one of the following three ways:

1. If you want to inject into a specific `MonoBehaviour`, you can specify it in the `LifetimeScope`'s inspector.
    - The `MonoBehaviour`s of all specified `GameObject` (and their children) will be automatically `Inject`ed when the `LifetimeScope` is initialized. ![](./assets/screenshot_auto_inject_gameobjects.png)
2. Use one of the `RegisterComponent*` methods to register the `MonoBehaviour` instance to the container.
    - In this case, the registered `MonoBehaviour` will both `Inject` and be `Inject`ed into other classes.
    - See [Register MonoBehaviour](../registering/register-monobehaviour)
3. To inject into dynamically-generated `MonoBehaviour`s at runtime (e.g. from prefabs), use `IObjectResolver.Instantiate` instead of [`UnityEngine.Object.Instantiate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate). (Factory patterns and object generation expressions can be registered.)
    - See [Register Callbacks](../registering/register-callbacks)
    - See [Register Factory](../registering/register-factory)


## Why doesn't VContainer automatically inject into all `MonoBehaviour`s?

- Unity doesn't provide a good way to listen for the creation of all `GameObject`s or `MonoBehaviour`s. Rather than having some cases that are automatically `Inject`ed and some that are not, we decided on explicit `Inject`ion that you can use to fit your own needs.
- We do not recommend excecuting `Inject` directly on `MonoBehaviour`s; instead, use `InjectGameObject` on the owning `GameObject`.
  - This is because the purpose of VContainer and DI is inversion of control of MonoBehaviour.
  - If a `MonoBehaviour` needs an explicit `Inject` call, you risk losing the advantages of Unity's prefab portability.
